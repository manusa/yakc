Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.","type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"x-kubernetes-patch-strategy":"merge"},"generateName":{"description":"GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided.
