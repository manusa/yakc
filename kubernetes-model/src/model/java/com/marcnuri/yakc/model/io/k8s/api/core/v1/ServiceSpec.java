In either case, if you do not specify an ipFamily explicitly, it will default to the cluster's primary IP family. This field is part of an alpha feature, and you should not make any assumptions about its semantics other than those described above. In particular, you should not assume that it can (or cannot) be changed after creation time; that it can only have the values "IPv4" and "IPv6"; or that its current value on a given Service correctly reflects the current state of that Service. (For ClusterIP Services, look at clusterIP to see if the Service is IPv4 or IPv6. For headless Services, look at the endpoints, which may be dual-stack in the future. For ExternalName Services, ipFamily has no meaning, but it may be set to an irrelevant value anyway.)
